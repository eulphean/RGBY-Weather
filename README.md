# RGBY
In this collaborative project with [Yaazd Contractor](https://yaazdcontractor.com/), Amay Kataria architected custom software that read the local weather data in New York and translated that into brightness and color temperature of each glass tube in the neon installation. Therefore, the color temperature of the installation reflects the ever-chaning temperature outside. The weather data was accessed from the internet using a python script, translated and communicated over serial protocol to an arduino, which controlled the brightness and the rhythm of the neon lights. This data driven neon installation is called [RGBY](https://yaazdcontractor.com/physical/rgby.html) and was presented at New York Design Week 2019.
